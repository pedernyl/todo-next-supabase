# Playwright E2E Testing Instructions

## 1. Authenticate and Create `storageState.json`
Before running any E2E tests, you must log in and save your authentication state:

```
npx playwright test tests/auth-setup.test.ts --headed --timeout=60000
```

- This will open a browser window.
- Log in with your GitHub account.
- When the test completes, a `storageState.json` file will be created in the project root.

## 2. Run All E2E Tests (excluding login script)
After you have created `storageState.json`, run all other Playwright tests with:

```
npx playwright test tests/*.spec.ts
```

- This will execute all E2E tests except the login script.
- If you need to re-authenticate, repeat step 1.

---

**Note:**
- Do not commit `storageState.json` to version control (it is in `.gitignore`).
- Only run the login script when you need to refresh your authentication state.
