-- Purpose:
-- Creates/replaces public.get_categories_with_has_active_todos(owner_id, completed, deleted)
-- and returns category rows for the owner with an extra computed field:
--   has_active_todos = true when the category has at least one todo in todos_compat
--   where completed = false and deleted_timestamp is null
--   and optionally by category ID.
--
-- How to add this to the database:
-- Run this SQL directly in the Supabase SQL editor.
-- This function is not wired to a corresponding admin update module.
